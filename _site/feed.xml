&lt;p&gt;The in-depth knowledge of rarefied gas dynamics is crucial to address challenges in a wide range of engineering problems, where gas flows are usually multiscale, i.e., covering a wide range of Knudsen numbers. As the traditional Navier–Stokes equations fail, gas kinetic equations are required to model the flows. So far, very few numerical methods are designed to efficiently solve the multiscale gas dynamics and reveal the role of internal degrees of freedom of gas molecules. In this work, a general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) is proposed to find steady-state solutions of the gas kinetic equations for molecular gas flows accurately and efficiently, where the gas kinetic equations are solved together with the macroscopic synthetic equations that expedite solutions towards the steady state. In the macroscopic synthetic equations, while the momentum equation is the same as that used in the GSIS for monatomic gas, two energy equations are introduced here for polyatomic gases: one is for the translational energy and the other for the internal energy; these equations are derived exactly from the gas kinetic equations hence no approximation is made in final solutions. The Fourier stability analysis is performed to show that the GSIS permits fast convergence to steady-state solutions in the entire flow regime; meanwhile the asymptotic analysis shows that the GSIS recovers the Navier–Stokes equations when the Knudsen number is small, even on the spatial grid with cell size much larger than the molecular mean free path. With all these unique features, several challenging numerical examples are given to show that the proposed GSIS is a promising tool to simulate multiscale molecular gas flows and investigate the effects of internal degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="GSIS" /><category term="polyatomic gas" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-01-01-poly-gsis-cmame.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-01-01-poly-gsis-cmame.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">You?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/team/you/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You?" /><published>2021-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/team/you</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/team/you/">&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;/join-mfX&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn of ways to join our research group!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="team" /><summary type="html">Click here to learn of ways to join our research group!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/team/anonymous.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/team/anonymous.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fast Convergence and Asymptotic Preserving of the General Synthetic Iterative Scheme</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/up-gsis-siam/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fast Convergence and Asymptotic Preserving of the General Synthetic Iterative Scheme" /><published>2020-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/up-gsis-siam</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/up-gsis-siam/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently the general synthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) was proposed for the Boltzmann equation [W. Su et al., J. Comput. Phys., 407 (2020), 109245], where various numerical simulations have shown that (i) the steady-state solution can be found within dozens of iterations at any Knudsen number, and (ii) the solution is accurate even when the spatial cell size in the bulk region is much larger than the molecular mean free path, i.e., the Navier–Stokes solutions are recovered at coarse grids. The first property indicates that the error decay rate between two consecutive iterations decreases to zero along with $K$, while the second one implies that the GSIS asymptotically preserves the Navier–Stokes limit when the Knudsen number approaches zero. This paper is first dedicated to the rigorous proof of both properties. Second, several numerically challenging cases (especially the two-dimensional thermal edge flow) are used to further demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of GSIS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="GSIS" /><category term="fast convergence" /><category term="asymptotic preserving" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-12-14-up-gsis-siam.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-12-14-up-gsis-siam.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Molecular physics of jumping nanodroplets</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/drop-jump-nano/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Molecular physics of jumping nanodroplets" /><published>2020-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/drop-jump-nano</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/drop-jump-nano/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation processor-chip cooling devices and self-cleaning surfaces can be enhanced by a passive process that requires little to no electrical input, through coalescence-induced nanodroplet jumping. Here, we describe the crucial impact thermal capillary waves and ambient gas rarefaction have on enhancing/limiting the jumping speeds of nanodroplets on low adhesion surfaces. By using high-fidelity non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with well-resolved volume-of-fluid continuum calculations, we are able to quantify the different dissipation mechanisms that govern nanodroplet jumping at length scales that are currently difficult to access experimentally. We find that interfacial thermal capillary waves contribute to a large statistical spread of nanodroplet jumping speeds that range from 0–30 m s^−1, where the typical jumping speeds of micro/millimeter sized droplets are only up to a few m s^−1. As the gas surrounding these liquid droplets is no longer in thermodynamic equilibrium, we also show how the reduced external drag leads to increased jumping speeds. This work demonstrates that, in the viscous-dominated regime, the Ohnesorge number and viscosity ratio between the two phases alone are not sufficient, but that the thermal fluctuation number (Th) and the Knudsen number (Kn) are both needed to recover the relevant molecular physics at nanoscales. Our results and analysis suggest that these dimensionless parameters would be relevant for many other free-surface flow processes and applications that operate at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="md" /><category term="rarefied" /><category term="fluctuations" /><category term="droplets" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-13-drop-jump-nano.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-13-drop-jump-nano.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Coupling Molecular Dynamics and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo using a general and high-performance code coupling library</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/coupling-md-to-dsmc-comp-fluid/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coupling Molecular Dynamics and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo using a general and high-performance code coupling library" /><published>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/coupling-md-to-dsmc-comp-fluid</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/coupling-md-to-dsmc-comp-fluid/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain-decomposed method to simultaneously couple the classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods is proposed. This approach utilises the MPI-based general coupling library, the Multiscale Universal Interface. The method provides a direct coupling strategy and utilises two OpenFOAM based solvers, mdFoam+ and dsmcFoam+, enabling scenarios where both solvers assume one discrete particle is equal to one molecule or atom. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable complex multi-scale simulations involving micro, meso and macroscopic elements, as found with problems like evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results are presented to show the fundamental capabilities of the method in terms of mass and kinetic energy conservation between simulation regions handled by the different solvers. We demonstrate the capability of the method by deploying onto a large supercomputing resource, with attention paid to the scalability for a canonical NVT ensemble (a constant number of atoms N, constant volume V and constant temperature T) of Argon atoms. The results show that the method performs as expected in terms of mass conservation and the solution is also shown to scale reasonably on a supercomputing resource, within the known performance limits of the coupled codes. The wider future of this work is also considered, with focus placed on the next steps to expand the capabilities of the methodology to allow for indirect coupling (where the coarse-graining capability of the DSMC method is used), as well as how this will then fit into a larger coupled framework to allow a complete micro-meso-macro approach to be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="mui" /><category term="dsmc" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-05-mui-coupling-comp-fluid.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-05-mui-coupling-comp-fluid.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
