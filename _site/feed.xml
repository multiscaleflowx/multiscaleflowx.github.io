&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the Poiseuille mass flow rate along microchannels shows a stationary point as the fluid density decreases, referred to as the Knudsen minimum. Surprisingly, if the flow characteristic length is comparable to the molecular size, the Knudsen minimum disappears, as reported for the first time by Wu et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 794, 2016, pp. 252–266). However, there is still no fundamental understanding why the mass flow rate monotonically increases throughout the entire range of flow regimes. Although diffusion is believed to dominate the fluid transport at the nanoscale, here we show that the Fick’s first law fails in capturing this behaviour, and so diffusion alone is insufficient to explain this confined flow phenomenon. Rather, we show that the Knudsen minimum disappears in tight confinements because the decay of the mass flow rate due to the decreasing density effects is overcome by the enhancing contribution to the flow provided by the fluid velocity slip at the wall.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="molecular dynamics" /><category term="kinetic theory" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2022-07-25-knudsen-minimum-disappearance.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2022-07-25-knudsen-minimum-disappearance.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Methane scattering on porous kerogen surfaces and its impact on mesopore transport in shale</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/methane-scattering-kerogen/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Methane scattering on porous kerogen surfaces and its impact on mesopore transport in shale" /><published>2022-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/methane-scattering-kerogen</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/methane-scattering-kerogen/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revealing the scattering behaviour of gas molecules on porous surfaces is essential to develop accurate boundary conditions for kinetic transport models that describe the gas dynamics in shale reservoirs. Here, we use high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the gas–surface interactions between methane molecules and realistic organic kerogen surfaces, and to assess the applicability of the widely used scattering kernels. Our results show that the tight matrix porosities have a negligible effect on the timescale and lengthscale of the scattering process, which can be considered instantaneous in time and local in space. Although reflected velocity distributions reveal that the common Maxwell, Cercignani–Lampis and Yamamoto scattering models fail to fully capture the scattering details of methane on kerogen, especially when the incident molecular speeds are high, the Maxwell model predicts best the reflected angular beam pattern and the overall reflected velocity distribution for rough kerogen surfaces. However, for low-speed impingement, more characteristic of shale applications, all scattering models give similar velocity distributions, which are driven by the high degree of gas–surface accommodation observed. We find that a Maxwell model with a calibrated tangential momentum accommodation coefficient, which approaches unity as the surface roughness increases to 2 , is enough to reproduce comparable velocity profiles and mass flow rates inside moderately confined kerogen mesopores. Deviations between the Maxwell model and our molecular simulations are only observed for highly rarefied transport problems, but this rarefaction lies beyond the realm of shale reservoir applications. This paper, therefore, reports the first scattering study on porous and rough kerogen surfaces, and demonstrates the applicability of the Maxwell model, which can be readily incorporated into gas kinetic solvers to predict the apparent permeability of shale with mesopore and macropore networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="scattering" /><category term="kerogen" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2022-05-15-methane-scattering-kerogen.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2022-05-15-methane-scattering-kerogen.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sina promoted to Senior Lecturer</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/sina-promotion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sina promoted to Senior Lecturer" /><published>2022-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/sina-promotion</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/sina-promotion/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/team//sina-haeri/&quot;&gt;Sina&lt;/a&gt; is promoted to Senior Lecturer.

&lt;p&gt;Ice accumulation on solid surfaces is a severe problem for safety and functioning of a large variety of engineering systems, and its control is an enormous challenge that influences the safety and reliability of many technological applications. The use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is popular, but as ice nucleation is a rare event when compared to simulation timescales, the simulations need to be accelerated to force ice to form on a surface, which affects the accuracy and/or applicability of the results obtained. Here, we present an alternative seeded MD simulation approach, which reduces the computational cost while still ensuring accurate simulations of ice growth on surfaces. In addition, this approach enables, for the first time, brute-force all-atom water simulations of ice growth on surfaces unfavorable for nucleation within MD timescales. Using this approach, we investigate the effect of surface wettability and structure on ice growth in the crucial surface–ice interfacial region. Our main findings are that the surface structure can induce a flat or buckled overlayer to form within the liquid, and this transition is mediated by surface wettability. The first overlayer and the bulk ice compete to structure the intermediate water layers between them, the relative influence of which is traced using density heat maps and diffusivity measurements. This work provides new understanding on the role of the surface properties on the structure and dynamics of ice growth, and we also present a useful framework for future research on surface icing simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="icing" /><category term="seeded md" /><category term="interfacial region" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-12-20-icing-seeded-md.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-12-20-icing-seeded-md.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sritay’s paper published in Nanoscale!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/sritay-paper-nanoscale/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sritay’s paper published in Nanoscale!" /><published>2021-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/sritay-paper-nanoscale</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/sritay-paper-nanoscale/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/team/mistry-sritay&quot;&gt;Sritay&lt;/a&gt;’s recent work on boron nitride and carbon nanotube modelling has been published in &lt;em&gt;Nanoscale&lt;/em&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have long been heralded as the material of choice for next-generation membranes. Some studies have suggested that boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) may offer higher transport of pure water than CNTs, while others conclude otherwise. In this work, we use a combination of simulations and experimental data to uncover the causes of this discrepancy and investigate the flow resistance through BNNT membranes in detail. By dividing the resistance of the nanotube membranes into their contributing components, we study the effects of pore end configuration, membrane length, and BNNT atom partial charges. Most molecular simulation studies of BNNT membranes use short membranes connected to high and low pressure reservoirs. Here we find that flow resistances in these short membranes are dominated by the resistance at the pore ends, which can obscure the understanding of water transport performance through the nanotubes and comparison between different nanotube materials. In contrast, it is the flow resistance inside the nanotubes that dominates microscale-thick laboratory membranes, and end resistances tend to be negligible. Judged by the nanotube flow resistance alone, we therefore find that CNTs are likely to consistently outperform BNNTs. Furthermore, we find a large role played by the choice of partial charges on the BN atoms in the flow resistance measurements in our molecular simulations. This paper highlights a way forward for comparing molecular simulations and experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="experiments" /><category term="md" /><category term="nanotubes" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-10-07-bnnt-cnt-nano.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-10-07-bnnt-cnt-nano.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Carlos’s recent paper highlighted by Physics of Fluids!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/carlos-paper-editors-pick/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Carlos’s recent paper highlighted by Physics of Fluids!" /><published>2021-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/carlos-paper-editors-pick</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/carlos-paper-editors-pick/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/team/corral-carlos&quot;&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt;’s recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Physics of Fluids&lt;/em&gt; has been higlighted as Editor’s pick!

&lt;p&gt;Molecular transport through tight porous media is crucial to shale gas exploration, but deeper insights of the elemental physics are still required, particularly under high pressures and nanoscale confinements, where Navier–Stokes and Boltzmann solutions are no longer valid. In this work, we carry out a fundamental and systematic study of self-diffusion using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, varying fluid rarefaction, confinement, and surface friction. We differentiate between fluid–fluid and fluid-wall collisions to identify the interplay of the underpinning diffu- sive mechanisms, namely, molecular and Knudsen diffusion. We find that the Bosanquet formula, which has been used for describing rarefied gases, is also able to provide a good semi-analytical description of self-diffusivities in confined dense fluids, as long as the pore height is not smaller than five molecular diameters. Importantly, this allows us to predict the self-diffusion coefficient, regardless of the fluid rarefaction, confinement state, and surface roughness, in a wide range of Knudsen numbers that were not possible before. Often as a source of debate, we prove here that despite strong fluid inhomogeneities arising in these conditions, the Einstein self-diffusivity can still be used within Fick’s law, provided boundary effects are considered when using Fick’s setup. Finally, we notice that a previously identified linear scaling of self-diffusivities with confinement is only valid in the limit of low densities and frictionless walls, which is not representative of shale reservoirs. This work will serve as a foundation for investigating the anomalous gas transport behavior observed in the recent work of dense, confined fluids.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="kinetic theory" /><category term="nanochannels" /><category term="rarefied gas dynamics" /><category term="diffusion coefficient" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-08-18-diffusivity-dense-confined.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-08-18-diffusivity-dense-confined.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
