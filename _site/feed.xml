&lt;p&gt;Ice accumulation on solid surfaces is a severe problem for safety and functioning of a large variety of engineering systems, and its control is an enormous challenge that influences the safety and reliability of many technological applications. The use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is popular, but as ice nucleation is a rare event when compared to simulation timescales, the simulations need to be accelerated to force ice to form on a surface, which affects the accuracy and/or applicability of the results obtained. Here, we present an alternative seeded MD simulation approach, which reduces the computational cost while still ensuring accurate simulations of ice growth on surfaces. In addition, this approach enables, for the first time, brute-force all-atom water simulations of ice growth on surfaces unfavorable for nucleation within MD timescales. Using this approach, we investigate the effect of surface wettability and structure on ice growth in the crucial surface–ice interfacial region. Our main findings are that the surface structure can induce a flat or buckled overlayer to form within the liquid, and this transition is mediated by surface wettability. The first overlayer and the bulk ice compete to structure the intermediate water layers between them, the relative influence of which is traced using density heat maps and diffusivity measurements. This work provides new understanding on the role of the surface properties on the structure and dynamics of ice growth, and we also present a useful framework for future research on surface icing simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="icing" /><category term="seeded md" /><category term="interfacial region" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-12-20-icing-seeded-md.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-12-20-icing-seeded-md.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Martin’s paper published in Journal of Chemical Physics!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/martin-paper-book-chapter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Martin’s paper published in Journal of Chemical Physics!" /><published>2021-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/martin-paper-book-chapter</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/martin-paper-book-chapter/">&lt;p&gt;Martin’s recent work on seeded MD of surface icing has been published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Chemical Physics&lt;/em&gt;, and a separate book chapter by Springer Press!

&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have long been heralded as the material of choice for next-generation membranes. Some studies have suggested that boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) may offer higher transport of pure water than CNTs, while others conclude otherwise. In this work, we use a combination of simulations and experimental data to uncover the causes of this discrepancy and investigate the flow resistance through BNNT membranes in detail. By dividing the resistance of the nanotube membranes into their contributing components, we study the effects of pore end configuration, membrane length, and BNNT atom partial charges. Most molecular simulation studies of BNNT membranes use short membranes connected to high and low pressure reservoirs. Here we find that flow resistances in these short membranes are dominated by the resistance at the pore ends, which can obscure the understanding of water transport performance through the nanotubes and comparison between different nanotube materials. In contrast, it is the flow resistance inside the nanotubes that dominates microscale-thick laboratory membranes, and end resistances tend to be negligible. Judged by the nanotube flow resistance alone, we therefore find that CNTs are likely to consistently outperform BNNTs. Furthermore, we find a large role played by the choice of partial charges on the BN atoms in the flow resistance measurements in our molecular simulations. This paper highlights a way forward for comparing molecular simulations and experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="experiments" /><category term="md" /><category term="nanotubes" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-10-07-bnnt-cnt-nano.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-10-07-bnnt-cnt-nano.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Carlos’s recent paper highlighted by Physics of Fluids!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/carlos-paper-editors-pick/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Carlos’s recent paper highlighted by Physics of Fluids!" /><published>2021-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/carlos-paper-editors-pick</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/carlos-paper-editors-pick/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/team/corral-carlos&quot;&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt;’s recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Physics of Fluids&lt;/em&gt; has been higlighted as Editor’s pick!

&lt;p&gt;Molecular transport through tight porous media is crucial to shale gas exploration, but deeper insights of the elemental physics are still required, particularly under high pressures and nanoscale confinements, where Navier–Stokes and Boltzmann solutions are no longer valid. In this work, we carry out a fundamental and systematic study of self-diffusion using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, varying fluid rarefaction, confinement, and surface friction. We differentiate between fluid–fluid and fluid-wall collisions to identify the interplay of the underpinning diffu- sive mechanisms, namely, molecular and Knudsen diffusion. We find that the Bosanquet formula, which has been used for describing rarefied gases, is also able to provide a good semi-analytical description of self-diffusivities in confined dense fluids, as long as the pore height is not smaller than five molecular diameters. Importantly, this allows us to predict the self-diffusion coefficient, regardless of the fluid rarefaction, confinement state, and surface roughness, in a wide range of Knudsen numbers that were not possible before. Often as a source of debate, we prove here that despite strong fluid inhomogeneities arising in these conditions, the Einstein self-diffusivity can still be used within Fick’s law, provided boundary effects are considered when using Fick’s setup. Finally, we notice that a previously identified linear scaling of self-diffusivities with confinement is only valid in the limit of low densities and frictionless walls, which is not representative of shale reservoirs. This work will serve as a foundation for investigating the anomalous gas transport behavior observed in the recent work of dense, confined fluids.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="kinetic theory" /><category term="nanochannels" /><category term="rarefied gas dynamics" /><category term="diffusion coefficient" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-08-18-diffusivity-dense-confined.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2021-08-18-diffusivity-dense-confined.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Pore-scale gas flow simulations by the DSBGK and DVM methods</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/pore-dsbgk-dvm-cf/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pore-scale gas flow simulations by the DSBGK and DVM methods" /><published>2021-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/pore-dsbgk-dvm-cf</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/pore-dsbgk-dvm-cf/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shale gas flow at the pore scale is very challenging to simulate due to high Knudsen numbers (Kn), low speeds and complicated pore geometries. The direct simulation BGK (DSBGK) method and the discrete velocity method (DVM) are promising methods to simulate three-dimensional (3D) gas flows in the shale rock. As the grid-convergence accuracy and computational cost highly depend on the spatial and molecular velocity grids, here we present a rigorous study of the computational performance of the two methods by simulating gas flows through the standard 3D Sierpinski carpet. In this study, we found reasonable agreement between the DSBGK and DVM simulations when comparing the velocity profiles and permeability curves obtained by using fine spatial and velocity grids. However, the grid convergence of the DSBGK simulation is faster than that of the DVM, which requires a very large number of spatial and velocity grids for convergence. Consequently, the DSBGK simulation is orders of magnitude cheaper than the DVM simulation in terms of the CPU time and memory usage. While the DVM requires a high-performance computing facility to meet the memory demand of several hundreds of gigabyte for simulating this 3D flow problem, the DSBGK simulation can run on an ordinary laptop. This work therefore demonstrates the DSBGK method as a practical simulation tool for 3D pore-scale gas flows in the shale rock. Converged results generated in this study can be used as comparison data by other simulation methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="porescale" /><category term="Sierpinski" /><category term="dsbgk" /><category term="dvm" /><summary type="html">Abstract Shale gas flow at the pore scale is very challenging to simulate due to high Knudsen numbers (Kn), low speeds and complicated pore geometries.
