&lt;p&gt;Next-generation processor-chip cooling devices and self-cleaning surfaces can be enhanced by a passive process that requires little to no electrical input, through coalescence-induced nanodroplet jumping. Here, we describe the crucial impact thermal capillary waves and ambient gas rarefaction have on enhancing/limiting the jumping speeds of nanodroplets on low adhesion surfaces. By using high-fidelity non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with well-resolved volume-of-fluid continuum calculations, we are able to quantify the different dissipation mechanisms that govern nanodroplet jumping at length scales that are currently difficult to access experimentally. We find that interfacial thermal capillary waves contribute to a large statistical spread of nanodroplet jumping speeds that range from 0–30 m s^−1, where the typical jumping speeds of micro/millimeter sized droplets are only up to a few m s^−1. As the gas surrounding these liquid droplets is no longer in thermodynamic equilibrium, we also show how the reduced external drag leads to increased jumping speeds. This work demonstrates that, in the viscous-dominated regime, the Ohnesorge number and viscosity ratio between the two phases alone are not sufficient, but that the thermal fluctuation number (Th) and the Knudsen number (Kn) are both needed to recover the relevant molecular physics at nanoscales. Our results and analysis suggest that these dimensionless parameters would be relevant for many other free-surface flow processes and applications that operate at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="md" /><category term="rarefied" /><category term="fluctuations" /><category term="droplets" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-13-drop-jump-nano.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-13-drop-jump-nano.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Coupling Molecular Dynamics and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo using a general and high-performance code coupling library</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/coupling-md-to-dsmc-comp-fluid/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coupling Molecular Dynamics and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo using a general and high-performance code coupling library" /><published>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/coupling-md-to-dsmc-comp-fluid</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/coupling-md-to-dsmc-comp-fluid/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain-decomposed method to simultaneously couple the classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods is proposed. This approach utilises the MPI-based general coupling library, the Multiscale Universal Interface. The method provides a direct coupling strategy and utilises two OpenFOAM based solvers, mdFoam+ and dsmcFoam+, enabling scenarios where both solvers assume one discrete particle is equal to one molecule or atom. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable complex multi-scale simulations involving micro, meso and macroscopic elements, as found with problems like evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results are presented to show the fundamental capabilities of the method in terms of mass and kinetic energy conservation between simulation regions handled by the different solvers. We demonstrate the capability of the method by deploying onto a large supercomputing resource, with attention paid to the scalability for a canonical NVT ensemble (a constant number of atoms N, constant volume V and constant temperature T) of Argon atoms. The results show that the method performs as expected in terms of mass conservation and the solution is also shown to scale reasonably on a supercomputing resource, within the known performance limits of the coupled codes. The wider future of this work is also considered, with focus placed on the next steps to expand the capabilities of the methodology to allow for indirect coupling (where the coarse-graining capability of the DSMC method is used), as well as how this will then fit into a larger coupled framework to allow a complete micro-meso-macro approach to be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="mui" /><category term="dsmc" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-05-mui-coupling-comp-fluid.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-10-05-mui-coupling-comp-fluid.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mean-field kinetic theory approach to Langmuir evaporation of polyatomic liquids</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/evap-pof/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mean-field kinetic theory approach to Langmuir evaporation of polyatomic liquids" /><published>2020-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/evap-pof</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/evap-pof/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evaporation of polyatomic liquids into near-vacuum conditions is investigated by using the Enskog–Vlasov model. Molecules are approximated as classical rigid rotators, and the collisional energy exchanges between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are dealt with by the Borgnakke–Larsen method. The distribution function of evaporated molecules and the evaporation coefficient are evaluated in a wide range of liquid bulk temperatures and inelastic collision fractions. It is found that the translational velocity distribution function is well approximated by a drifted bi-Maxwellian, while the rotational energy follows the Boltzmann distribution at a temperature that varies between the separation and the parallel temperatures as the inelastic collision fraction increases. The evaporation coefficient based on the separation temperature turns out to be independent of the inelastic collision fraction and only mildly dependent on the liquid bulk temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="enskog" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2019-09-29-evap-pof.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2019-09-29-evap-pof.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dense gas flow simulations in ultra-tight confinement</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/dense-gas-pof/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dense gas flow simulations in ultra-tight confinement" /><published>2020-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/dense-gas-pof</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/dense-gas-pof/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling dense gas flows inside channels with sections comparable to the diameter of gas molecules is essential in porous medium applica- tions, such as in non-conventional shale reservoir management and nanofluidic separation membranes. In this paper, we perform the first verification study of the Enskog equation by using particle simulation methods based on the same hard-sphere collisions dynamics. Our in- house Event-Driven Molecular Dynamics (EDMD) code and a pseudo-hard-sphere Molecular Dynamics (PHS-MD) solver are used to study force-driven Poiseuille flows in the limit of high gas densities and high confinements. Our results showed (a) very good agreement between EDMD, PHS-MD, and Enskog solutions across density, velocity, and temperature profiles for all the simulation conditions and (b) numerical evidence that deviations exist in the normalized mass flow rate vs Knudsen number curve compared to the standard curve without confine- ment. While we observe slight deviations in the Enskog density and velocity profiles from the MD when the reduced density is greater than 0.2, this limit is well above practical engineering applications, such as in shale gas. The key advantages of promoting the Enskog equation for upscaling flows in porous media lie in its ability to capture the non-equilibrium physics of tightly confined fluids while being computationally more efficient than fundamental simulation approaches, such as molecular dynamics and derivative solvers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="edmd" /><category term="md" /><category term="enskog" /><category term="gas" /><category term="confinement" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-09-01-dense-gas-pof.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2020-09-01-dense-gas-pof.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
