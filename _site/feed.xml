&lt;p&gt;A domain-decomposed method to simultaneously couple the classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods is proposed. This approach utilises the MPI-based general coupling library, the Multiscale Universal Interface. The method provides a direct coupling strategy and utilises two OpenFOAM based solvers, mdFoam+ and dsmcFoam+, enabling scenarios where both solvers assume one discrete particle is equal to one molecule or atom. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable complex multi-scale simulations involving micro, meso and macroscopic elements, as found with problems like evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results are presented to show the fundamental capabilities of the method in terms of mass and kinetic energy conservation between simulation regions handled by the different solvers. We demonstrate the capability of the method by deploying onto a large supercomputing resource, with attention paid to the scalability for a canonical NVT ensemble (a constant number of atoms N, constant volume V and constant temperature T) of Argon atoms. The results show that the method performs as expected in terms of mass conservation and the solution is also shown to scale reasonably on a supercomputing resource, within the known performance limits of the coupled codes. The wider future of this work is also considered, with focus placed on the next steps to expand the capabilities of the methodology to allow for indirect coupling (where the coarse-graining capability of the DSMC method is used), as well as how this will then fit into a larger coupled framework to allow a complete micro-meso-macro approach to be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="mui" /><category term="dsmc" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html">Abstract</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/comp-fluid.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/comp-fluid.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2020/09/29/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2020-09-29T18:44:14+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-29T18:44:14+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2020/09/29/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2020/09/29/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory.

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

My PhD investigated fluid flows at the nanoscale. In 2009 I developed a Molecular Dynamics (MD) software called mdFOAM within the third-party open-source software OpenFOAM, which I currently still lead. In my PhD I developed MD flow controller tools in arbitrary complex geometries for applying continuum-molecular boundary conditions, and which were then integrated within concurrent CFD-MD hybrid simulations that offer computational cheaper solutions with molecular-level accuracy. From 2009-2011 I worked as a postdoctoral Research Associate at Strathclyde investigating water flow through carbon-nanotube membranes for seawater purification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 I became a Research Fellow and Lead Senior Researcher on an EPSRC Programme Grant (£2.4M; EP/I011927/1) entitled “Non-equilibrium Fluid Dynamics for Micro/Nano Engineering Systems”. This was a collaborative 5-year programme between Edinburgh/Strathclyde University (PI: Prof Jason Reese), Warwick University (Prof Duncan Lockerby), Daresbury Laboratory (Prof Dave Emerson) and a number of industrial partners. During this period I developed an arsenal of hybrid continuum-molecular methods for solving various engineering problems computationally-efficiently in both nano liquid and micro rarefied gas flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ambition is to lead the James Weir Fluids Laboratory to advance our understanding of fundamental flow physics and chemistry in micro/nano systems, with the aim of utilising these research advances to develop new technologies with capabilities beyond any currently conceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My expertise is in the fluid dynamics of rarefied flows, which presents an important technological challenge, with long-term research and industrial implications. My group is among the first to develop lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods for simulating rarefied flows. In particular, we were the first to prove that high-order LB models can be reduced to the linearised BGK equation, giving confidence that LB models can be applied to highly rarefied gas dynamics. We also developed a fast spectral method for solving the Boltzmann equation, considering different molecular potential models. My other research activities centre on complex flow physics, including multiphase flows, droplet technologies and granular flows. Since joining Strathclyde University, my research has been funded by the EPSRC, EU FP7, STFC, Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the Leverhulme Trust. I am a Fellow of Institute of Mechanical Engineers, and a Fellow of Institute of Physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently hold Weir Chair in Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics.
