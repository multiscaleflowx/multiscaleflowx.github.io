<p>Accelerating ice nucleation in confined liquids is desirable in applications like food freezing, cryopreservation, and ice casting, but current techniques have their limitations. The use of high-frequency acoustic waves (AW) is a promising alternative but remains poorly-understood. We employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate AW-induced ice nucleation within confined nanopores. By systematically varying vibrational amplitude and frequency, we identify five distinct nucleation regimes, forming a comprehensive regime map that links these parameters to nucleation outcomes. Our simulations reveal that ice nucleation is preceded by formation of ice-like clusters, and is strongly influenced by negative pressure induced by surface vibrations. A strain-based criterion is introduced to generalize the findings to larger lengthscales. This enables us to propose a universal framework for controlling ice formation via surface vibrations in industrial applications.</p>]]></content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2025-05-13-NanoscaleVibrationIceNucleation.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2025-05-13-NanoscaleVibrationIceNucleation.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Nanoscale surface effects on heterogeneous vapor bubble nucleation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/NanoscaleSurfaceBubbleNucleation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nanoscale surface effects on heterogeneous vapor bubble nucleation" /><published>2025-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/NanoscaleSurfaceBubbleNucleation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/NanoscaleSurfaceBubbleNucleation/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Understanding the mechanisms underlying vapor bubble nucleation on solid surfaces is critical for multiple scientific and engineering applications, such as two-phase thermal management systems and turbomachinery, among others. While classical nucleation theory (CNT) explains how surface wettability influences nucleation by modifying the free energy barrier for smooth surfaces, the interplay between nanoscale surface roughness and wettability for rough surfaces remains less clear. Using molecular dynamics simulations, this study demonstrates that CNT can accurately describe wettability effects on nucleation. In addition, we show how surface cavities can create active nucleation sites without requiring trapped gases. This occurs through spontaneous dewetting of cavities at elevated temperatures, which reduces the nucleation barrier. Our results reveal that cavity-induced nucleation enhancement depends on both wettability and geometry, with dewetting promoting nucleation on lyophobic surfaces and rewetting neutralizing this effect for more lyophilic surfaces. These findings provide insights for designing surfaces to either enhance or suppress bubble nucleation.</p>]]></content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ionic adsorption on bulk nanobubble interfaces and its uncertain role in diffusive stability</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/IonicAdsorptionNanobubbles/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ionic adsorption on bulk nanobubble interfaces and its uncertain role in diffusive stability" /><published>2025-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/IonicAdsorptionNanobubbles</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/IonicAdsorptionNanobubbles/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p><em>Hypothesis:</em>
Bulk nanobubbles have been proposed to improve gas exchange in a variety of applications, such as in water treatment, theragnostics, and microfluidic surface cleaning. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the mechanism responsible for their reportedly long lifetimes, which contradicts classical understanding of diffusive bubble dynamics. Recently, there has been increasing support for an electrostatic stability mechanism, following from experiments that observe negatively charged zeta potentials around nanobubbles.
<em>Simulations:</em>
We use high-fidelity Molecular Dynamics simulations to model bulk nanobubbles under mechanical equilibrium in a sodium iodide electrolyte solution, to investigate ionic adsorption on the liquid-gas interface, and resulting zeta potential. We critically examine the hypothesised electrostatic stress underpinning this previously suggested stability mechanism, which is theorised to stabilise the nanobubbles against dissolution by counteracting the otherwise dominant effects of surface tension, however, has been too difficult to directly measure in experiments.
<em>Findings:</em>
Ions adsorb onto the liquid-gas interface, confirming an Electric Double Layer (EDL) distribution around the nanobubble with an estimated 𝜁0 ∼ −10 mV zeta potential, in accordance with experiments. However, we find no significant electrostatic stress exerted on the nanobubble surface, as any ion charge density in the EDL is completely neutralised by the rearrangement of the water molecules. As a result, the internal gas pressure is still well predicted by the standard Laplace pressure equation (with a fitted Tolman length correction 𝜆 = 0.31 nm), challenging an essential assumption underlying the previously proposed theories, and we instead speculate on alternative mechanisms for electrostatic-based stability.</p>]]></content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2025-05-06-IonicAdsorptionNanobubbles.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2025-05-06-IonicAdsorptionNanobubbles.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spectral mechanisms of solid/liquid interfacial heat transfer in the presence of a meniscus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/SpectralMechanismsSolidLiquidInterfaceHeatPCCP/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spectral mechanisms of solid/liquid interfacial heat transfer in the presence of a meniscus" /><published>2025-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/SpectralMechanismsSolidLiquidInterfaceHeatPCCP</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers/paper/SpectralMechanismsSolidLiquidInterfaceHeatPCCP/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>In this study, we employ molecular simulations to investigate the enhancement in thermal conductance at the solid/liquid interface in the presence of a meniscus reported previously (Klochko et al., <em>Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.</em>, 2023, <strong>25</strong>(4), 3298–3308). We vary the solid/liquid interaction strength at Lennard-Jones interfaces for both confined liquid and meniscus systems, finding that the presence of a meniscus yields an enhancement in the solid/liquid interfacial thermal conductance across all wettabilities. However, the magnitude of the enhancement is found to depend on the surface wettability, initially rising monotonously for low to moderate wettabilities, followed by a sharp rise between moderate and high wettabilities. The spectral decomposition of heat flux formalism was applied to understand the nature of this phenomenon further. By computing the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the heat fluxes within both the interfacial solid and liquid, we show that the initial monotonous rise in conductance enhancement predominantly stems from a rise in the coupling of out-of-plane vibrations within both the solid and the liquid. In contrast, the subsequent sharp rise at more wetting interfaces is linked to sharp increases in the utilization of the in-plane modes of the solid and liquid. These observations result from the interplay between the solid/liquid adhesive forces and the liquid/vapor interfacial tension. Our results can aid engineers in optimizing thermal transport at realistic interfaces, which is critical to designing effective cooling solutions for electronics, among other applications.</p>]]></content><author><name>Multiscale Flow X</name><email>multiscaleflowx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="paper" /><category term="multiscale" /><category term="md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2025-05-01-SpectralMechanismsSolidLiquidInterfaceHeatPCCP.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/papers/2025-05-01-SpectralMechanismsSolidLiquidInterfaceHeatPCCP.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Latest mfX publications in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, Physical Review E, and Nano Letters!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/Paper-update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Latest mfX publications in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, Physical Review E, and Nano Letters!" /><published>2025-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/Paper-update</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/Paper-update/"><![CDATA[<p>We have been busy!
