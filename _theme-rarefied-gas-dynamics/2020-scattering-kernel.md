The Boltzmann equation, or any other kinetic model equation, must be supplemented by boundary conditions that model the gas-surface interactions (GSI). These are typically formulated via the so-called scattering kernels and are of paramount importance in modelling non-equilibrium gas dynamics transport. Applications motivated by this research area range from predicting aerodynamic drag forces on satellites operating at very low Earth orbits to enhanced microprocessor cooling and manufacturing, where the gas transport occurs at micro/nanoscale confinements.

This project uses high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations to accurately resolve the trajectories of molecules in the scattering process and aims to (a) assess the applicability of widely used scattering kernels and (b) propose new scattering models that account for all physical effects that occur at the surface (e.g. physisorption, roughness etc).
