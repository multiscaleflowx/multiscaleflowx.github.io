How gas flows behave in microscale geometries or at low pressure is important to many emerging technologies and engineering challenges. Such examples include: next-generation photolithography machines that manufacture smaller, faster processor chips; thermal management of high-powered electronics using evaporating nanopipe membranes; and high-precision electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The behaviour of these rarefied flows are, however, not well understood, requiring models of both particle and continuum physics. Existing simulation tools are not fit-for-purpose; they are either too costly to deal with these problems (e.g. DSMC) or inaccurate to reach the full range of Knudsen numbers (e.g. Navier Stokes).

In this research project a new open-source 3D flow model is being developed that uses machine learning techniques to intelligently couple accurate particle solvers to efficient continuum models, obtaining the best-of-both worlds within a single numerical tool.
