The critical importance of understanding the rheology of granular materials for seemingly countless natural and industrial processes, has resulted in significant interdisciplinary research efforts for several decades. Of such efforts, one of the most significant contributions to the understanding of dry granular flows was the discovery of a relationship referred to as the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu(I)">
rheology. This phenomenological model relates the shear stress to confining pressure ratio <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu\equiv 
\tau/P">, with shear stress <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\tau"> and pressure <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P">, to the dimensionless inertial number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I"> which describing the relative importance of inertia and confining stresses. Despite the many successful applications of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu(I)"> rheology, it loses accuracy for several key aspects of dry granular flows including application to dilute cases, accounting for particles with a finite stiffness, also known as soft particles, and nonlocal effects which have been highlighted as causing significant deviations from classical <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu(I)"> models. Elucidated from this model, is the roll of the particle velocity fluctuations often described as granular temperature, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T">. Acknowledgement of the granular temperature for constitutive modelling efforts has now led to several recent remarkable proposals, mitigating many of the weaknesses
encountered by traditional <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu(I)"> models.
In this work through Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations we are working on the development of new constitutive models based on the kinetic energy to address the shortcomings of the classical <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu(I)"> rheology.
