The powder-based additive manufacturing processes are promising manufacturing techniques that enable the rapid production of prototypes and lately for weight-sensitive/multi-functional parts at small volumes, with almost arbitrary complexity. The process builds the final parts layer-upon-layer by going through three main stages during each cycle: (1) deposition of a layer of fine powder (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D_p\approx 30 \mu m">) on a fabrication surface through powder spreading – e.g. in selective laser melting (SLM) – or spraying – e.g. in laser metal deposition (LMD); (2) laser heating at specific locations; (3) fusion of the powder grains through melting and solidification. 

A lack of understanding of the impact of powder grain shape on this process, has forced the industry to place stringent requirements on powder characteristics (such as high grain sphericity and narrow size distribution) to increase process repeatability and improve the powders’ processability. These requirements also result in high cost of virgin powders and a high wastage of raw material due to lack of recyclability, and hence causing the technology readiness level (TRL) to remain low despite substantial advantages, such as the production of complex parts, mass customisation, and on-demand manufacturing. 
To overcome these difficulties, the Oak Ridge National Lab's report  identifies an urgent technological need for particle-scale (microscale) simulations of the process and integration of the simulation software with the powder characterisation data. Despite some progress in the past few years, the available models are of low-fidelity and various phenomena including vaporisation and het transfer within the bed are not properly considered. This project addresses this urgent need by (1) developing a novel procedure to integrate the powder characterisation data with the simulation software at temperatures exceeding 500°C equivalent to those experienced in the preheated build chamber, and (2) providing a validated computational framework for particle-scale modelling of a full cycle of the process.
