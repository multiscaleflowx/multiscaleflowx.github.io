Wind energy has been developing rapidly over the past two decades. With 417 TWh generated, wind power covered 15% of the EU’s electricity demand in 2019 while in the same year, the sector has enjoyed over €19bn in new investments. In Q1 2020, offshore/onshore wind contributed to 64% of renewable – equivalent to 30% of the total – electricity generation in the UK. 
Large wind turbines consist of several blades with aerofoil shaped cross sections to generate lift and maintain the rotation. The blades are naturally subjected to high-speed winds and are bombarded by solid (e.g. hailstone) and/or liquid (e.g. rain droplets) “particles” depending on the installation site. Such impacts, increase the surface roughness by damaging the coatings which causes a substantial aerodynamic performance penalty as the friction drag increases and results in an earlier onset of stall. As the severity of erosion increases it will ultimately jeopardise the structural integrity of the blades resulting in unplanned downtime and high maintenance costs. 
A major issue during the design stage is the lack of predictive models to optimise the aerodynamic performance and materials concurrently. The motion of particles near the blades and the impact mechanics should ideally be considered during the design stage to guide the material selection and reduce impact probabilities through geometric optimisation. Such a predictive model will also determine the rate of mass removal allowing for scheduled maintenance which substantially lowers the associated costs. The key research question is therefore to understand the dynamical role of impinging particles in the erosion process, enabling quantitative prediction of the erosive impact of particles and mass removal rate from the surfaces.
