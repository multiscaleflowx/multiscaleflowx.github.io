I am  a postdoctoral research associate in mfX. I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Thessaly in 2019 and continued as a postdoctoral researcher until 2021 when I joined the University of Edinburgh. During my PhD studies and postdoctoral appointment I worked with various aspects of computational rarefied gas dynamics, ranging from flows encountered in MEMS to flows in large vacuum pumping systems.  

Currently I work for the EPSRC funded project "Multiscale Simulation of Rarefied Gas Flow for Engineering Design" aiming to provide an accurate and efficient computational framework for flows in the whole range of gas rarefaction.
