I am a computational engineering scientist at the University of Edinburgh, exploring the nanoscale world through simulation. My research combines molecular dynamics with continuum mechanics to understand how droplets move, how surfaces clean themselves, and how heat flows at interfaces.

Current focus areas include boiling and evaporation at nanoscale surfaces, ice nucleation and icephobic surface design, nanoscale heat transfer at solid-liquid interfaces, and machine learning potentials for molecular simulations.

I lead a research group primarily funded by an ERC Starting Grant (NANO-COOL, 2024-2029) investigating nanomaterial-enhanced cooling for extreme thermal management. Published in Physical Review Letters, Nano Letters, and Journal of Fluid Mechanics. Research featured in BBC, The Times, Metro, and The Conversation.
