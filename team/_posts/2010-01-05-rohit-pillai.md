I am Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, with a background and publication record in continuum fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and multiphysics modelling. I was appointed to this current role in September 2018, less than a year after being awarded my PhD. 

In the last 5 years, my research has featured in prominent top-quality journals (such as Physical Review Letters and Nano Letters), the press (BBC, Times, Metro), and led to a radio interview on BBC Newsnight Scotland. I have also secured Â£235,000 of research funding from internal and external sources in that time.
