I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Multiscale Thermofluids at the University of Edinburgh. I obtained my Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2022. My research primarily focuses on fundamentally understanding the icing behaviour on surfaces at the nanoscale and exploring ways of de/anti-icing surfaces for different engineering applications.

My Master’s research was about the determination of the cohesive/adhesive debonding at the interfaces of asphalt binder-aggregates using molecular dynamics approaches. In my undergraduate degree, I worked on the fabrication of a superhydrophobic coating that was applied to the pavement surface for anti-icing.

My Ph.D. research includes investigating the underpinning nanoscale science of i) ice-growth and adhesion on surfaces for engineering applications; ii) acoustothermal effect producing heat flux at the ice formed adjacent to the surface; and iii) identifying how this heat can be used for ice reduction/removal.
