I am a second year PhD student in the Institute of Multiscale Thermofluids, focussing on meso-scale modelling of the effects of cavitation. 

In 2019, I graduated from the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, with a Masters in Aero-Mechanical Engineering. During the course of my degree, I carried out research on instabilities in pressure relief systems using optimisation (symbolic regression). For my final year project, my team worked in collaboration with the European Space Agency and a number of teams from across Europe to design a moon base and construct relevant prototypes. 

My current research lies within the field of targeted drug delivery via nano- or micro-bubbles. The technique has many potential benefits but there are dangers associated with the cavitation of these bubbles due to the resulting high-speed fluid jet, high temperatures, and shockwaves. I aim to improve the controllability of the technique by studying the post-cavitation behaviour within the body, considering the fluid-structure interaction and material damage to nearby biological tissue. Numerical modelling of this process involves the coupling of the Lattice Boltzmann method (liquid phase) and Peridynamics (solid phase).
