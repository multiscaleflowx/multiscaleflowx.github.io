I am a Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at University of Strathclyde (2015-2020) following my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical engineering at Aix-Marseille University. 

My research centres on numerical studies of rarefied gas flows, particularly applications to MEMS, vacuum devices and ultra-tight porous media. These works investigate different aspects of fluid dynamics, including flow separation, heat and mass transfer. I am also interested in developing efficient kinetic solver for rarefied gas flow in arbitrary geometries, for example, porous media. 

I am currently developing parallel kinetic solver for rarefied gas flow, in which different kinetic equations and different types of and gas-wall boundary condition are considered to adapt various flow problems.
