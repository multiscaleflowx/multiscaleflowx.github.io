I am a PhD student at the Institute of Multiscale Thermofluids (IMT) at University of Edinburgh’s School of Engineering. I obtained my MSc degree from Bogazici University’s Mechanical Engineering Department. Moreover, I have two years of industry experience in the automotive sector with Standard Profil Group as a Design and Simulation Team Leader.

During my MSc studies, I carried out research about micro- and nano-scale heat transfer. For my thesis, I investigated the thermal size effects induced by localized heating during micro-Raman spectroscopy and developed a numerical model for thermal conductivity measurements of sub-micron semiconductor thin films. This non-Fourier model employed the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) utilizing Finite Volume Discrete Ordinates Method (FVDOM) for spatial and angular discretization.

My PhD research focuses on computational modelling of nanobubble cavitation and collapse dynamics, specifically incorporating the influence of electric double layer outside the nanobubble surface. Therefore, I will investigate the impact of electric and magnetic fields on nanobubble behavior using Molecular Dynamics (MD). I aim to uncover a wide range of potential applications for nanobubbles in areas such as in water and waste-water treatment, cancer treatment, and surface cleaning.
