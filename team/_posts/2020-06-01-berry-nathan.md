I am a final year PhD student in the Institute for Materials and Processes at the University of Edinburgh, with a focus on developing rheological models of granular materials.  In 2017, I graduated from the University of Strathclyde with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering with Financial Management.   

Currently, my research spans all scales involved in modelling granular materials. At the micro (particle) scale, I have spent time developing new particle contact models to more accurately model non-spherical granular particle interactions, solving several issues with respect to the multi-sphere discrete element method.  At the intermediate (meso) scale, I have investigated the validity of boundary conditions for the multi-sphere discrete element method, specifically, developing a successful implementation of Lees-Edwards boundary conditions. My research at the macroscopic scale of granular materials is centred around constitutive modelling. Namely, I have developed new Kinetic energy based constitutive equations for granular materials, which can successfully capture the behaviour of both dilute and dense granular systems.
