I am a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at the University of Edinburgh. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. My research focuses on different aspects of multiphase flow ranging from micro- to nano-scales with a particular emphasis on fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and phase change. I have studied different aspects of droplet dynamics, condensation of steam bubbles, and molecular scale boiling, which includes: (i) influence of the external electric field, (ii) surface vibration, and (iii) influence of external heat flux. These types of multi-physics flow problems are becoming increasingly relevant for the innovation of energy-efficient engineering systems. It is also important for the development of next-generation equipment for biomedical and clinical applications.

My doctoral research analysed the dynamics of drops and its manipulation during electro-wetting and dielectrophoresis. In particular, I focused on including the nonlinear electro-hydrodynamic couplings such as interfacial charge transport, interface deformation, and resulting fluid motion.

My recent work includes investigation of bubble nucleation due to surface vibration. I am currently working on analysing gas flow in nano-scale porous media, which occurs during the exploration from shale gas reservoirs. I am also looking at developing a multiscale simulation-for-design framework to investigate de-icing using nanoscale vibration-driven (acoustothermal) heating.
