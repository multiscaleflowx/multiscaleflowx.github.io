I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Edinburgh. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. My research interests involve different aspects of multiphase flow ranging from micro to nano scales with emphasis on droplet dynamics with external force fields, condensation of steam bubbles and boiling.

My present research focuses on the effect of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on nanoscale liquid films and droplets. I am also looking at developing a hybrid multiscale technique for simulating the acoustowetting of microscale drops.
