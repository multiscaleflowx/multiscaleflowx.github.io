I am a Research Associate. I am originally from China, where I obtained my PhD certification in Aerospace Engineering at Beihang University. Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I had postdoctoral research experiences in the Italian National Research Council and the University of Strathclyde.
 
My research mainly focuses on the computational nonequilibrium gas dynamics, with emphasis on developing accurate and efficient numerical models and methods for kinetic equations and multiscale simulation. I am interested in studying the nonequilibrium gas flow phenomena with a variety of engineering applications, e.g., high-altitude flight, micro-electro-mechanical system, unconventional natural gas production, and vacuum science. I am also interested in the sophisticated modelling of nonequilibrium relaxation in shock-heated flow, occurring in the context of space exploration.

I am currently working on the development of simplified model for the Boltzmann-Enskog equation to describe the flow physics of confined dense gases.
