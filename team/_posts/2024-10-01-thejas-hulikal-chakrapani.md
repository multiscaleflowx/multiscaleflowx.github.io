I am a Research Associate with Dr. Rohit Pillai investigating interfacial heat transfer at various solid-liquid interfaces, with a focus on efficient heat management for dense electronics. My interest lies in using Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics (MDPD) to study thermodynamics and non-equilibrium flow phenomena in porous media and nanochannels.

During my PhD at the University of Twente, I developed computational models to examine ink-paper interactions relevant to inkjet printing applications. My work involved using the coarse-grained particle-based simulation technique MDPD to explore how simple and complex fluids penetrate different porous structures. The PhD thesis resulting from my work was chosen as a highlight by the J. M. Burgers Centrum fluid mechanics school, The Netherlands. My supervisors were [Dr. Wouter K. den Otter](https://people.utwente.nl/w.k.denotter) and [Prof. Stefan Luding](https://www2.msm.ctw.utwente.nl/sluding/).

As a postdoctoral researcher at TU Delft with [Prof. Hadi Hajibeygi](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/geoscience-engineering/sections/reservoir-engineering/staff/academic-staff/profdr-h-hajibeygi), [Dr. Othonas Moultos](https://omoultosethtudelft.github.io/web/), and [Prof. Thijs Vlugt](https://thijsvlugt.github.io/website/), my research shifted to subsurface hydrogen storage, particularly in calculating thermophysical properties of hydrogen mixtures. By employing molecular dynamics simulations, I computed mutual diffusivities for hydrogen-carbon dioxide mixtures, aiding in understanding the mixing of these gases. Additionally, I co-developed a method using Monte Carlo simulation technique to compute thermodynamic factors, which are essential for calculating Fick diffusivities.
