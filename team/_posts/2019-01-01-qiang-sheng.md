I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Edinburgh. I am completing my PhD from Queen Mary University of London. Prior to that, I obtained a Master degree in Mechanical Engineering from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University, China, where I worked on thermal creep flow in a high order moment method.

My research interest covers non-equilibrium gas flow and interfacial heat/mass transfer, including heterogeneous nucleation of vapor and behaviors of nanoscale droplets. My present work is to investigate the transport of non-equilibrium gas at nanoscale by molecular dynamics simulation.
