I am currently starting my 3rd year as a PhD student at the IMT, within the School of Engineering in the University of Edinburgh. My background in Chemical Engineering, where I completed a MSc programme (2019) in the University of Manchester after obtaining my BSc degree in the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela (Spain), allowed me to get in touch with the principles of statistical mechanics and the capabilities of computer methods to study the physics of fluids.

My research is framed within an international grant, with collaborators from the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM) in Saudi Arabia, that pursues state-of-the-art procedures for optimising the multiscale modelling of nanoflows. More specifically, my focus is on better understanding the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the flow behaviour when non-ideal gases are restricted to geometries comparable to the molecular size. 

My ongoing work assesses the influence of rarefaction phenomena and ultra-tight confinements through a combination of high-fidelity computational simulations and theoretical analysis based on appropriate kinetic models.
