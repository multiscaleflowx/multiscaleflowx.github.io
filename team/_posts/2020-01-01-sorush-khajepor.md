I have studied a wide variety of fluid mechanics and computer programming courses from *fundamentals of fluids*, and *numerical programming* during my undergraduate program to advanced courses such as *continuum mechanics*, *advanced engineering math*, *microflows and nanoflows*, *CFD programming*, *parallel processing* in my MSc program. My MSc dissertation is about the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulation of nanojets and centrifugal jets.

An important aspect of my research is numerical programming where I employ *C/C++*, *Fortran*, *C#*, or *Python* to create CFD and DEM models and analyse them. The codes I use are mostly High-performance (parallelized with OpenMP and MPI) and can be run on supercomputers like *Cirrus* and *ARCHER*.

I have a PhD in computational fluid mechanics where I focused on simulating multiphase flows with the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. I have coded and tested many different LB models and boundary conditions. 

I have two years experience of working in the oil and gas industry where I have been involved in different commercial and R&D projects mostly focusing on CFD modelling, numerical app development. 


I am currently a research associate at the University of Edinburgh and concentrating on simulating powder spreading processes of additive manufacturing. A high-performance computational framework is being created to understand underlying physical phenomena. This helps us to improve the processability of powders.
