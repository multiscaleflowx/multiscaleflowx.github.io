Kinan is a third-year PhD student at Edinburgh University. His research aims to develop a numerical method to model particle erosion. This is achieved by coupling Discrete element method and Dual horizon Peridynamics.

In 2019 he graduated from the University of Strathclyde with a Masters in Advanced Mechanical Engineering with Distinction, having completed a study of particle-turbulence interactions in the wake of bluff bodies for the final year thesis.
