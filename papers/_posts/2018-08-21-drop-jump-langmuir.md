# Abstract 

We report the results of molecular dynamics investigations into the behavior of nanoscale water droplets on surfaces subjected to cyclic-frequency normal vibration. Our results show, for the first time, a range of vibration-induced phenomena, including the existence of the following different regimes: evaporation, droplet oscillation, and droplet lift-off. We also describe the effect of different surface wettabilities on evaporation. The outcomes of this work can be utilized in the design of future nanoengineered technologies that employ surface/bulk acoustic waves, such as water-based cooling systems for high-heat-generating processor chips, by tuning the vibration frequency and amplitude, as well as the surface wettability, to obtain the desired performance.
