# Abstract 

The effective permeability of large shale samples provides useful insights into shale gas production. However, its determination can only be achieved through upscaling, since the direct pore-scale simulation of gas flows in large rock samples is not feasible due to the high computational cost and absence of pore connectivity in sample images. Although the Brinkman formulation is widely used in the permeability upscaling of conventional rocks, how to choose the effective viscosity in this coarse-scale model is not clear. Moreover, its application in shale rocks, where the rarefaction effects are important so that the conventional Navierâ€“Stokes equations are inadequate, is rare, and its accuracy has not been assessed. This study aims to address the above two problems, by comparing the Brinkman solutions of several two-dimensional and three-dimensional random porous media containing fractures with the fine-scale solutions of the Stokes and Boltzmann equations (for continuum and rarefied gas flows, respectively). It is found that the use of the fluid viscosity in the Brinkman model, instead of the controversial effective viscosity, leads to accurate results for the cases considered. Additionally, the macroscopic quantity in rarefied gas flows in shale rocks is well predicted by the Brinkman model for a wide range of gas rarefaction, since the error is found to be less than 7%, while neglecting the rarefaction effects leads to significant underestimation of effective permeability (up to 90% in the cases studied). Although heterogeneity and anisotropy of the porous medium increase the error of the effective permeability derived from the Brinkman model, generally speaking, the effective permeability extracted from this coarse-scale model compares favorably to its fine-scale counterpart.
