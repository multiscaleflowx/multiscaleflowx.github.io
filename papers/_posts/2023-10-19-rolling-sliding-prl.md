# Abstract

Molecular simulations discover a new mode of dynamic wetting that manifests itself in the very earliest stages of spreading, after a droplet contacts a solid. The observed mode is a "rolling" type of motion, characterized by a contact angle lower than the classically assumed value of 180°, and precedes the conventional "sliding" mode of spreading. This motivates the development of a novel continuum framework that captures all modes of motion.
