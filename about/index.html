    <div class="bighead"> Why 'X'? </div>
    <hr class="thick">

	<p>In the sciences and engineering disciplines we are always solving for the variable X. The ‘X’ in our research vision signifies the multiple levels of physics or the multiple levels of software that are needed to solve multiscale flow problems. Future technologies in health, transport and energy demand we provide solutions from new design-for-simulation software that accurately and efficiently span large time and lengthscales: from nano, micro, meso to macro scales.</p>

    <hr class="thick">
	<p> In 2006, Prof Jason Reese (Weir Professor of Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics), with Yonghao Zhang and Tom Scanlon, formed the James Weir Fluids Laboratory in multiscale fluid dynamics at the University of Strathclyde. The aim of this partnership was to fulfil the need to develop multiscale computational solutions, and technologies that leverage atoms into machines to deal with 21st century challenges in energy, health, transportation and climate change. A partnership in micro and nano fluid mechanics was also formed with collaborators in Warwick University and STFC Daresbury Laboratory after a successful 5-year EPSRC Programme Grant. </p>
 
	<p>In 2013, Jason Reese was appointed as the Regius Professor in Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, the 9th incumbent since the professorship was established in 1868 by Queen Victoria. Here Jason Reese won a 5-year EPSRC Programme Grant, many accolades, such as the Lord Kelvin Medal and the RAEng Chair in Emerging technologies. In 2019, Jason Reese sadly passed away. This research group lives on because of him.</p> 
 
	<p>Prof Yonghao Zhang (Weir Professor of Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics, Strathclyde) joined Edinburgh in 2020 to become the 1st Jason Reese Chair in multiscale fluid mechanics in honour of Jason Reese’s visionary research in multiscale engineering sciences. The combined research group has a complete set of world-leading expertise in multiscale techniques making it one of the largest multiscale modelling groups in the UK.</p>
