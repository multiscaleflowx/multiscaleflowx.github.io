Ice formation and accretion on surfaces can severely damage infrastructures such as highways, dams, and buildings or shorten their service lives; reduce the energy efficiency of wind turbines, and hinder the operational performance of instrumentation on aircraft, ships, and helicopters. In daily life in the winter, the icing on the pavement results in countless accidents that can potentially lead to a loss of life. Traditional de-icing methods include mechanical removal, surface-heating, and spraying chemicals. While mechanical and heating are energy-consuming, the chemicals are proven to be detrimental to the environment. Therefore, new de-icing methods, such as fabricating anti-icing surfaces, are expected to be developed to efficiently hinder ice formation. To achieve this, the underpinning physics of the ice adhesion needs to be better understood, whereby the ice adhesion strength on a substrate can be reduced and the ice can be effectively removed.
