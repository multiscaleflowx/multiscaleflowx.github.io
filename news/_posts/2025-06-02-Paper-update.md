Our group has been at hard at work, with four new papers published in the last month!

[Pengxu] published his first PhD paper on resolving the mechanisms of acoustic-wave-induced ice nucleation in [*Nanoscale*][1], along with [Rohit] and [Saikat].

[Abdullah] published his second PhD paper in [*Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics*][2] on spectral mechanisms for heat transfer in solid/liquid interfaces, in the presence of a liquid-vapour meniscus, with [Rohit] and [Sree Hari].

[Patrick] publsihed his third paper on surface roughness effects on heterogeneous vapour bubble nucleation in [*Journal of Chemical Physics*][3], along with [Rohit] and [Duncan].

And finally, [Duncan] published his most recent work in [*Journal of Colloid and Interface Science*][4], investigating ionic adsorption on bulk nanobubbles, questioning one of the leading theories for nanobubble stability, with [Patrick] and [Livio].

Stay tuned for more research articles, exploring the beyond the limits of classical thermodynamic understanding in multiscale fluids!
