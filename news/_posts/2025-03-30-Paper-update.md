We have been busy! We are pleased to announce three new publications in [*The Journal of Physical Chemistry C*][1] ([Abdullah], [Sree Hari], and [Rohit]), [*Physical Review E*][2] ([Yichong] and [Livio]), and [*Nano Letters*][3] ([Saikat] and [Rohit])!

These research projects each employ high-fidelity Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore non-trivial non-equilibrium phenomena, which would not be possible with more conventional continuum-based modelling. Stay tuned for more papers on the way!
