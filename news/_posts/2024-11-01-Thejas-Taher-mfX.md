We are delighted to welcome [Thejas Hulikal Chakrapani] and [Taher Meydando] into mfX. Thejas joins us as a PDRA investigating heat transfer at solid-fluid interfaces, having completed his PhD at the University of Twente. Taher joins us a 1st year PhD student, and will perform MD simulations of nanobubble cavitation under electric fields. We look forward to working with them both, and excited to see how they progress!
