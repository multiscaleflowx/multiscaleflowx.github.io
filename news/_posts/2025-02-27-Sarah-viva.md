We are delighted to announce that [Sarah Davidson] passed her PhD viva with minor corrections! Her thesis: *Mesoscopic Modelling of Membrane-Fluid Interactions using Peridynamics: Application to Deformable and Fracturing Beams* modelled the action of 2D bicuspid valves, in veins of the leg, using a coupled Peridynamics (PD), Immersed Boundary (IB), and cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM), and investigated the adverse effect with damaged and aging valve tissue.

Congratulations again to **Dr** Sarah Davidson, and we wish her all the best for the future!
