	<p>This website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a>, inspired by the elegant designs of <a href="http://drummondlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Allan Drummond</a> and <a href="https://ccs-lab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woo Young Ahn</a> (these were both in turn inspired by <a href="http://bedford.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trevor Bedford's</a> site). Rather than branching any of these templates, we started from a basic <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> template, and adopted/adapted bits of other code during customization.

	<p>This site’s source code is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/multiscaleflowx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and deployed using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
