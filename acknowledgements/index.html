			<p>Jason sadly passed away in March 2019. He founded this research group and was the pioneer in developing the research area of multiscale fluid dynamics in current and future technologies that rely on micro and nanoscale flows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O4crC0w23c">see video</a>). While he was extremely successful in his career (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Reese">here</a> for more information) and a top scholar, he will be remembered by us for what a genuinely nice person he was, and how much of his energy he gave to supporting and developing early career researchers, that are now spread in top academic and industrial positions around world. In his memory, the University founded a Chair in his name.</p>

	<p>This website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, inspired by the elegant designs of <a href="http://drummondlab.org/">D. Allan Drummond</a> and <a href="https://ccs-lab.github.io/">Woo Young Ahn</a> (these were both in turn inspired by <a href="http://bedford.io/">Trevor Bedford's</a> site). Rather than branching any of these templates, we started from a basic <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> template, and adopted/adapted bits of other code during customization.
