<!-- Scholarship and openings info -->


	<h1 id="phd-positions">PhD Scholarships</h1>
	<p> We regularly have EU/UK PhD scholarships to award. To be eligible, you need to have a first class degree (or equivalent) honours engineering degree (or a degree in a relevant subject area, such as in applied maths, informatics, or computer science) and have a strong background in mathematics, physics, and computer programming. For candidates who have not yet graduated, transcript evidence of likely degree level will be sufficient. In the first instance, please email a full Curriculum Vitae and cover letter to us at the email address above, explaining why you are interested in pursuing a PhD in our research group, with the names and contact details of two referees. Our scholarships are fully-funded for UK or EU students, which cover University fees and a tax-free maintenance grant. Other overseas students who apply for a PhD will need to show proof they can provide the difference in the university fees. </p>

	<h1 id="pdra-positions">Research Associate Vacancies</h1>
	<p> All our postdoc positions are advertised on <a href="https://www.jobs.ac.uk/">jobs.ac.uk</a> and the <a href="https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/">university vacancies page</a>. Postdocs are normally focused on specific research programmes.  If you would like to be added to our mailing list, please let us know via the email address above, and we will inform you whenever a post becomes available. </p>

	<h1 id="fellowship-positions">Fellowships</h1>
	<p> If you are interested in applying to any of the UK-funded postdoctoral fellowship schemes and want to be hosted by our research group, please email us in the first instance with a full Curriculum Vitae, identifying which scheme you are interested in applying to.

	<h1> Visiting Scientists</h1>
	<p>We regularly host international leading scientists from around the world either on sabbaticals, short visits, CSC scholarships etc. This is a great medium to exchange ideas and knowledge that can be transformed into collaborative grants or research papers. At the moment we are not able to host anyone due to the current pandemic and new University policy on visitors. Please check back soon.</p>

	<h1> Research and Training </h1>
	<p> Researchers coming into our research group will join a consortium of internationally-leading UK research institutions (Daresbury Laboratory, Warwick University, Strathclyde University, and Glasgow University) working on particle and multiscale modelling of fluid dynamics problems (see <a href="https://www.micronanoflows.ac.uk/">www.micronanoflows.ac.uk</a>). This consortium collaborates with several industrial partners. Exceptional research and training opportunities in our research group, include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>regular weekly meetings and monthly group meetings to discuss the research progress;</li>
	<li>collaborating with a large interdisciplinary network of researchers;</li>
	<li>regular opportunities for travel to international conferences to present new research;</li>
	<li>training and experience in state-of-the-art engineering research software;</li>
	<li>integral industrial involvement, including secondments into leading multinational companies;</li>
	<li>close mentoring from other programme investigators and experienced postdoctoral researchers;</li>
	<li>exceptional career development opportunities with strong institutional support of early career researchers.</li>
	</ul></p>
