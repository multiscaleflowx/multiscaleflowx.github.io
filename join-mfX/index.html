	<div id="phd-positions" class="bighead">PhD Scholarships</div>
	<hr class="thick">
	<p> We regularly have home PhD scholarships to award. To be eligible, you need to have a first class degree (or equivalent) honours engineering degree (or a degree in a relevant subject area, such as in applied maths, informatics, or computer science) and have a strong background in mathematics, physics, and computer programming. For candidates who have not yet graduated, transcript evidence of likely degree level will be sufficient. In the first instance, please email a full Curriculum Vitae and cover letter to us at the email address above, explaining why you are interested in pursuing a PhD in our research group, with the names and contact details of two referees. Our scholarships are fully-funded for UK-resident students, which cover University fees and a tax-free maintenance grant. UK-resident status is applicable for UK, Irish, EEA and Swiss nationals, who have either been resident in the UK for more than 3 years before the start date of the PhD programme or who have settled status (also known as indefinite leave to remain or enter). Other overseas students who apply for a PhD will need to show proof they can provide the difference in the university fees. </p>
