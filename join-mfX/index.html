<!-- Scholarship and openings info -->


	<h1 id="phd-positions">PhD Scholarships</h1>
	<p> We regularly have EU/UK PhD scholarships to award. To be eligible, you need to have a first class degree (or equivalent) honours engineering degree (or a degree in a relevant subject area, such as in applied maths, informatics, or computer science) and have a strong background in mathematics, physics, and computer programming. For candidates who have not yet graduated, transcript evidence of likely degree level will be sufficient. In the first instance, please email a full Curriculum Vitae and cover letter to us at the email address above, explaining why you are interested in pursuing a PhD in our research group, with the names and contact details of two referees. Our scholarships are fully-funded for UK or EU students, which cover University fees and a tax-free maintenance grant. Other overseas students who apply for a PhD will need to show proof they can provide the difference in the university fees. </p>

	<h1 id="pdra-positions">Research Associate Vacancies</h1>
	<p> All our postdoc positions are advertised on <a href="https://www.jobs.ac.uk/"jobs.ac.uk> and the <a href="https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/">university vacancies page</a>. Postdocs are normally focused on specific research programmes. If you wish to enquire about current opportunities, please send us an email at the address above. </p>

	<h1 id="fellowship-positions">Fellowships</h1>
	<p> If you are interested in applying to any of the UK-funded postdoctoral fellowship schemes and want to be hosted by our research group, please email us in the first instance with a full Curriculum Vitae, identifying which scheme you are interested in applying to.
