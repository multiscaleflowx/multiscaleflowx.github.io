Our understanding of vapour bubble growth is currently restricted to asymptotic descriptions of their limiting behaviour. While attempts have been made to incorporate both the inertial and thermal limits into bubble growth models, the early stages of bubble growth have not been captured. This project accounts for both the changing inertial driving force and the thermal restriction to growth, and aims to develop inertio-thermal models of homogeneous/heterogeneous vapour bubble growth, capable of accurately capturing the evolution of a bubble from the nano- to themacro-scale. Model predictions are validated against: a) published experimental and numerical data, and b) our own molecular simulations. This has potential application in improving the performance of engineering devices, such as ultrasonic cleaning and microprocessor cooling, as well as in understanding of natural phenomena involving vapour bubble growth.
