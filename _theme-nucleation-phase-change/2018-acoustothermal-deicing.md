Ice formation not only influences our daily life in various scenarios, ranging from ice accumulation in the freezer to the accretion of ice on the windscreen of a car, but also has effects on global phenomena like climate change. Ice formation is desirable in many applications such as artificial cloud creation, preservation of biological substances, and food transportation. On the other hand, icing can lead to a loss of life by hindering the operational performance of instrumentation or navigation systems on aircraft, ships, and helicopters; Icing can also damage power lines and telecommunications equipment; reduce the energy efficiency of wind turbines, and hinder operational performance. Therefore, control of ice formation is of crucial importance in various industrial sectors.

Recent investigations have unraveled a novel surface-driven acoustothermal force which can superheat fluid within a few nanometres of the vibrating surface. The magnitude of this superheat can be tuned externally, so this provides a new capability to delay icing and/or melt formed ice. This project investigates how the chemical and structural properties of the surface, along with the applied acoustic parameters, impact the heating and melting dynamics during vibration.
