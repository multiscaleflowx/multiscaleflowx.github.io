A cylinder in a cross-flow is used as a fundamental configuration to investigate the impact of boundary-layer proximity on the flow characteristic around obstacles and the forces experienced by them. Special attention is paid to the low sub-critical range since, with the advent of small space crafts, a better understanding of the flow structures/forces around/on objects in a boundary layer in medium Reynolds (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10^2\leq \textrm{Re} \leq 10^3">) and Mach (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\textrm{Ma} \leq 0.7">) numbers is required. However, this regime is still almost completely ignored in the literature despite having a rich and complex physics. This gap in the knowledge is filled in this work through high-fidelity numerical simulations using massively parallel high-order CFD simulations.
